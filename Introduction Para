Introduction:
As an introduction to this case, we are creating a predictive model to aid the marketing campaign of a national veteransâ€™ organization in improving their cost effectiveness. By using variables like whether a 
person is a homeowner or not, their gender, and their wealth segment, we hope to increase the organization's overall response rate from 5.1% and their average donation amount to greater than $13. By examining 
these variables and creating a predictive model we hope to effectively capture the demographics and socioeconomic statuses of donors to maximize the organizations expected net profit.
